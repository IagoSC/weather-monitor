# Weather monitor

This project is a weather monitor with focus on sports.


# How does it work?

A consumer wants to have news on the weather for surfing for example: it asks the producer of the monitor to receive a message when waves are good for surfing (based on wind, local, temperature)
<!-- This is wrong, need to know better what values to monitor -->

# How to run
